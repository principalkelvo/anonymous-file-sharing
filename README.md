## Description

>> Data transmission over the internet has never been simpler, but sending sensitive information over email or a cloud service could be a mistake. There is always a danger that data could be intercepted, and in some circumstances, this could be disastrous. In many circumstances, it may be preferable to physically deliver data to a recipient using a secure storage mechanism, however this is frequently not feasible. The good news is that you can transmit files to other individuals using this anonymous file-sharing service without revealing any personal information about you or the recipient.
